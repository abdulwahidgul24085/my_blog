This blog is going to my experience and learning process that I get on the daily bases. The main idea would be for me to use this is a journal of all the things that I learn while exploring Science and technology.

I will be writing about Data Science, Computer Science, and Psychology. The last one is not my area of experience, but I am interested in it, so I have to write about it. I would like to say this explicitly that all of the idea and knowledge shared here are my opinions. If you are offended or disagree with some or all of them. Kindly send me an email. I would like to know your difference of opinion. 

My goal for this blog is to have a single resource which I always google. I would like to have them in one place. So, I don't track back my steps on how I go here. I was using Wordpress as the foundation, but know I am using Python Pelican framework and Github as the hosting services. More on this in another blog.
